Leveraged an Amazon dataset sourced from Kaggle to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) aimed at understanding the correlation between a delivery person's age and the time taken for delivery. Utilized data visualization tools such as seaborn and matplotlib to visually explore patterns and trends within the dataset. The primary objective was to uncover insights that could potentially enhance delivery efficiency and logistics planning in e-commerce operations. Employed linear regression modeling techniques to predict delivery times based on the age of the delivery personnel. Findings from the analysis contribute to the understanding of factors influencing delivery times and offer valuable insights for optimizing operational processes in the e-commerce sector.
